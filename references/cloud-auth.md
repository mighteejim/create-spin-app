# Fermyon Cloud Auth and Plugin

## Login

Use `spin cloud login` and complete the device code flow.

## Cloud Plugin

If `spin cloud` is missing, install the plugin with `spin plugins install cloud`. Newer Spin versions may auto-install the cloud plugin on first use, but still verify the command is available.

## Spin CLI

If `spin` is missing, ask the user to install the Spin CLI from official docs.
